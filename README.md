## One Hack Per Day

A blog by [Anthony Bau](mailto:dab1998@gmail.com). This is a place for me to talk about hacks that I do day-to-day. Every
hack is prototyped within about three hours.

I like statistical AI, signal processing, computer vision, and automation in general. I like working with CoffeeScript, which
you'll see come out in the hacks here.
